# Eye Exercise Project
> MIT xPRO - Week 8

This project was part of the course work required in the MIT xPRO Full-Stack development course taken.

## Description

A basic project to track the movement of the mouse. When the mouse pointer is moved there are two eyes which both have black eye balls. These eye balls will track the movement of the mouse in unison.

### Features

* A ominous looking background
* Two identical white eyes
* Two perfectly rounded black eye balls

## Installation

Clone the files that are in the Eye Exercise directory to your local machine.
Open a new tab in your browser window.
Drag and drop the eyes.js file onto the new tab.
The project will load an appear in your browser.
You will see two eyes appear and start following your mouse movements.

## Usage

### Usage:
Need to test your mouse is moving in the right way? Well, look no further. Launch this eye tracker and watch those two sligtly scary eyes follow your mouse as long as our heart desires.

### Expected outcomes:
Wonder.
Excitement.
Hidden fear.


## Support

If by some unexpected circumstance the eyes stops tracking, please get hold of me at gman.international@gmail.com and I will make it all right again.

## Roadmap

What are eyes without a nose, what is a nose without a mouth and what is a mouth without a face? 
These are all fantastic questions which we hope to solve in the future iterations of the Eye Exercise.
By the time we are done it just may need to be renamed to the Full Body Exercise.
Tracking mouse movements to eventually make a full body move across the screen is the goal here.
